Sprint 3: Uploading 4 Months of Biki Trips Data into R

Justine Espiritu

__*Project Description:*__
*A description of the project and what it is intended to do*
I'll be uploading 4 Months of Biki Trips Data into R. I'd like to learn commands that can simplify the trips data and remove the redundant data into separate tables, then I can explore and practice R queries/commands on the simplified Trips table

*A description of the files attached, and any instructions for someone downloading it to use*
This repo includes 4 csv files each representing a different month of Biki trip data

*Here is a description of other things I hope to do with this project for future reference*
With the simplified Trips table, I'd like to use queries to get interesting insights on stations, membership plans, and overage fees
